        <p>This is the first adventure in Statistics. The aim is to use the
          skills you have developed in Further Mathematics to complete a D&D
          inspired mission. Before you can complete this mission you need to
          master the uni variate component of the course.</p>

      <h2>Four characters have been hired to travel to a mushroom grove to
        harvest mushrooms for the local “good” witch. The forest they must
        travel through is rife with monsters and the undead. They have hired
        you to be their mathematician. You will be in constant contact throughout
        the journey from home base, in the village of "Cobraooga", in order to
        statistically analyse their options.<br>
        The above cards introduce them to you and give you some basic stats
        for each. You are told their name, age and shoe size etc.<br>
        You can use these stats to organise leadership roles and fight
        sequences should they be required. You know that you are going to need
        to use these names and numbers so you take some time before they leave
        to organise them.<br>
        <span>Can you remember the names and descriptions of data types?</span><br>
        Use your knowledge of Further Mathematics terminology to answer the
        following questions in order to proceed.<br>

              he see that the recoil force of the slingshot has knocked the pigmy on
               to his bottom.<br>The compression of the spine has killed him
